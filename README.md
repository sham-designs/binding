This website is created by Shambhavi Varma for project 3 of her course "Typography and Interaction 1" using HTML/CSS.
The website is a cultimation of 3 articles exploring the themes of rigidity and cultural norms in traditional graphic design.
The three articles are as follows:
- Is Graphic Design too White? - BY JONNY PATHAN
- There is no such thing as Neutral Graphic Design - BY ELLEN LUPTON AND LESLIE XIA
- Graphic Designâ€™s Factory Settings - BY Jacob Lindgren

The website has a very loud tone to challenge the traditional norms of clean and minimal graphic design popular in the west.
The typography has bold elements using the typeface "Climate Crisis", bold headings using the typeface "Anton" and a mono font called "Courier Prime".

			<h1>Graphic Design's Factory Settings</h1>

					“Design education not only teaches its technical and historical canon, or how to design, but more importantly teaches students how to be designers in society and in relation to capital,” writes designer Jacob Lindgren. 
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					“A school becomes a factory producing designers, one that, in keeping with the principles of ‘good design,’ turns them into efficient and interchangeable parts ready to hit the market.”
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					In a new essay, Lindgren proposes models that may help us undo this factory setting of graphic design.
				</p>

				<h2>Flusser’s Perspective</h2>
				<p>
					In his book of essays, <em>The Shape of Things</em>, Czech philosopher and media critic Vilém Flusser argues that factories are decreasingly places where goods are produced and increasingly places where new kinds of humans are produced.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					“Human history is the history of manufacturing and everything else is mere footnotes.”
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					For Flusser, learning was analogous to manufacturing: both being processes which are based on acquiring, producing, and passing on—or “turning”—information.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					“It becomes apparent that the factory is nothing but an applied school and the school nothing but a factory for the acquisition of information.”
				</blockquote>

				<h2>The Role of Design Education</h2>
				<p>
					Design education not only teaches its technical and historical canon, or how to design, but more importantly teaches students how to be designers in society and in relation to capital. A school becomes a factory producing designers, molding future designers into interchangeable units.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					“To what extent has this cycle, an entanglement of design and industry, come to be considered graphic design’s ‘factory settings’?”
				</blockquote>

				<h2>Historical Context: Bauhaus and Beyond</h2>
				<p>
					Graphic design is a practice inherently defined by its relationship to large-scale production and industry. Beginning with the Arts & Crafts movement and the Bauhaus, design education has long been intertwined with industrial production. The Bauhaus's educational strategy attempted to unify craft with industrial production, its motto being “Art into Industry.”
				</p>
				<p>
					While the Bauhaus anticipated an industrial revolution capable of delivering mass-produced design for social good, its artifacts were often handmade to imitate factories. As Mark Wigley posits, “The explicit agenda of Bauhaus was to design a new kind of human.”
				</p>

				<h2>The Bauhaus Legacy and Its Complications</h2>
				<p>
					The Bauhaus closed in 1933 due to political pressure, but its influence spread globally. Figures like Walter Gropius and Mies van der Rohe migrated to the US and shaped modernist design’s relationship with industry, architecture, and academia.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					“Despite its modernist intentions, the Bauhaus’s modernism became the face not of socialism or communism but of capitalism.”
				</blockquote>
			</section>
	
			<section>
				<h2>Contemporary Design Education</h2>
				<p>
					Much of today’s design curriculum still reflects the Bauhaus model. This model, however, is entrenched in Western principles and hegemony, leaving little room for alternative pedagogies that prioritize decoloniality, feminism, or ecological sustainability.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					“What would it look like to identify and replace the current power structures and ideologies embedded in contemporary design practice and pedagogy?”
				</blockquote>
			</section>
	
			<section>
				<h2>Reconfiguring Design Education</h2>
				<p>
					Alternative models of design education, like self-organized initiatives, aim to decouple design pedagogy from its institutional makeup. Projects like Parallel School and Spinning Triangles offer experimental approaches to learning, but these efforts often face challenges when trying to exist outside institutional structures.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					“Creating and prototyping these models at scale is a way of conducting critique and attempting to enact change within the larger structures they imitate.”
				</blockquote>
			</section>
	
			<section>
				<h2>Where Do We Turn?</h2>
				<p>
					If design education is a factory, how do we escape its confines? Vilém Flusser described the factory’s mode of production as “turning”: turning resources into goods, turning students into workers.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					“If the school is a factory, and the educational turn allows us to examine the conditions of our own manufacturing… as we exit, where should we turn?”
